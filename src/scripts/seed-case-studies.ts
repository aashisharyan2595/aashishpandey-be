    summary:
      "End-to-end redevelopment and UX redesign of a Shopify storefront for a global ice cream brand.",
    tags: ["Shopify Plus", "UX", "Delivery"],
    problem:
      "The Magnum Ice Cream Canada site needed a full redevelopment and UX redesign, coordinated across onshore and offshore teams working different hours, on a hard launch date.",
    approach:
      "I owned the end-to-end project plan — sequencing design, build, and QA against the launch date, tracking dependencies between teams in different time zones, and keeping stakeholders aligned on scope and risk as the build progressed.",
    outcome:
      "The site launched on schedule and stable, with a UX overhaul that improved the brand's positioning on the platform.",

    summary:
      "Owned the product lifecycle for an AI-powered storytelling platform, driving a 50% increase in traffic.",
    tags: ["Product Ownership", "Growth", "Prioritization"],
    problem:
      "StoryNest needed clearer prioritization — the backlog had more feature ideas than the team could ship, and it wasn't obvious which would actually move engagement.",
    approach:
      "I ran workflow analysis on how users actually moved through the product, used that to reprioritize the roadmap around the highest-leverage features, and drove strategic targeting decisions for where to invest next.",
    outcome:
      "Traffic grew 50% over the engagement, with a backlog that stayed prioritized against evidence instead of opinion.",

    tags: ["D2C", "Process Design", "Stakeholder Alignment"],
    problem:
      "Two related but separate D2C platforms were running on inconsistent delivery processes, which made it hard to scale support and slowed down every new request.",
    approach:
      "I partnered directly with Wipro stakeholders to design and standardize reusable delivery templates across both platforms, replacing ad hoc handling with a repeatable process.",
    outcome:
      "User handling capacity increased by 40%, with a shared process both platform teams could actually rely on.",

    problem:
      "Campaign landing pages were being built and left alone — no feedback loop from real user behavior back into design decisions.",
    approach:
      "I set up a GA4-driven iteration cycle across 10+ landing pages, combining analytics with SEO best practices to find and fix the specific points where users were dropping off.",
    outcome:
      "User engagement and social shares rose 25%, and the iteration process became the template for future campaign pages.",
